## Issue #1: Memory Leak in Board Rendering ⚠️ **CRITICAL** ✅ **FIXED**

### Location
- **File:** battleship.html
- **Lines:** 752-819
- **Function:** `renderBoard()`

### Problem Description
The `renderBoard()` function creates a new set of event listeners for every cell on the board each time it's called, but never removes the old event listeners. This causes:

1. **Memory leaks:** Old event listeners remain in memory even after `innerHTML = ''` clears the DOM
2. **Event listener accumulation:** With 100 cells per board × 2 boards × multiple re-renders, hundreds of orphaned listeners accumulate
3. **Performance degradation:** Each re-render adds more listeners, slowing down the game over time

### Impact
- **Severity:** High
- **User Impact:** Memory bloat and performance degradation during gameplay
- **Technical Debt:** Violates JavaScript best practices for event handling

### Example
Each time a ship is placed or a shot is fired, `renderBoard()` is called. For the player board alone:
- 100 cells × 6 event types (click, mouseenter, mouseleave, touchstart, touchend, touchmove)
- = 600 event listeners per render
- After 10 game actions: 6,000+ orphaned listeners

### Solution (Implemented)
Refactored to use **event delegation pattern**:
- Removed individual cell event listeners
- Added listeners to board container elements instead
- Used `cloneNode(false)` to clear old listeners before re-rendering
- Reduced total listeners from 700+ to 10 (5 per board)

### Before vs. After
```
BEFORE: 700+ individual cell event listeners
AFTER: 10 delegated event listeners on board containers
MEMORY REDUCTION: ~98%
```

## Issue #2: Code Duplication in Strategic Ship Placement 📋 **MEDIUM**

### Location
- **File:** battleship.html
- **Lines:** 1423-1518 (`strategicPlacePlayerShips`)
- **Lines:** 1536-1694 (`strategicPlaceComputerShips`)

### Problem Description
Nearly identical logic (~150 lines) is duplicated between player and computer strategic ship placement functions. Both functions:
1. Calculate probability maps for strategic placement
2. Use the same scoring algorithm for position evaluation
3. Apply identical placement validation logic
4. Only differ in the target board and ship list

### Impact
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Maintenance Cost:** Changes must be made in two places
- **File Size:** Adds ~150 unnecessary lines
- **Bug Risk:** Updates to one function may be forgotten in the other

### Code Similarity
```javascript
// strategicPlacePlayerShips (lines 1423-1518)
const map = Array(BOARD_SIZE).fill(null).map(() => Array(BOARD_SIZE).fill(0));
// ... identical probability calculation ...

// strategicPlaceComputerShips (lines 1536-1694)  
const map = Array(BOARD_SIZE).fill(null).map(() => Array(BOARD_SIZE).fill(0));
// ... identical probability calculation ...
```

### Suggested Solution
Create a unified `strategicPlaceShips(board, shipsList)` function that both methods can call, eliminating duplication.

## Issue #3: Inefficient DOM Queries with Attribute Selectors 🔍 **LOW**

### Location
- **File:** battleship.html
- **Lines:** 855, 876

### Problem Description
Multiple complex `querySelector` calls using attribute selectors:
```javascript
const cell = document.querySelector(`#playerBoard .cell[data-row="${r}"][data-col="${c}"]`);
```

These queries:
1. Parse complex CSS selectors
2. Search through DOM tree multiple times
3. Execute during time-sensitive operations (hover preview, shot animation)

### Impact
- **Severity:** Low
- **Performance Impact:** Minor (milliseconds per query)
- **Frequency:** Called on every hover/mouse movement during ship placement

### Suggested Solution
Store cell references in a 2D array during board creation:
```javascript
this.playerBoardCells = [];
this.computerBoardCells = [];
// Then access directly: this.playerBoardCells[row][col]
```

---

## Issue #4: Repeated Probability Map Array Creation 🎯 **MEDIUM**

### Location
- **File:** battleship.html
- **Lines:** 1135-1184
- **Function:** `calculateProbabilityMap()`

### Problem Description
The AI creates new arrays from scratch on every turn:
```javascript
calculateProbabilityMap() {
    const map = Array(BOARD_SIZE).fill(null).map(() => Array(BOARD_SIZE).fill(0));
    // ... recalculate everything ...
}
```

This happens:
1. Every AI turn (potentially 100+ times per game)
2. Even when board state hasn't changed significantly
3. Includes expensive nested loop calculations (O(n³) complexity)

### Impact
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Performance Impact:** Noticeable delay on AI turns (especially Hard difficulty)
- **CPU Usage:** Unnecessary computation

### Suggested Solution
Implement caching strategy:
```javascript
// Cache the map and invalidate only when board changes
this.cachedProbabilityMap = null;
this.lastBoardState = null;

calculateProbabilityMap() {
    if (this.cachedProbabilityMap && boardStateUnchanged()) {
        return this.cachedProbabilityMap;
    }
    // ... calculate and cache ...
}
```

## Issue #5: Excessive innerHTML Rebuilding for Ship Status 🚢 **LOW**

### Location
- **File:** battleship.html
- **Lines:** 1756-1783
- **Function:** `updateShipsStatus()`

### Problem Description
Ship status display is completely rebuilt on every update:
```javascript
playerStatus.innerHTML = this.playerShips.map(ship => {
    // ... generate HTML for all ships ...
}).join('');
```

This happens after:
- Every shot (hit or miss)
- Every ship placement
- Every board render

### Impact
- **Severity:** Low
- **Performance Impact:** Minor DOM thrashing
- **Frequency:** Multiple times per turn

### Suggested Solution
Use targeted updates:
```javascript
// Only update the specific ship that changed
updateShipStatus(shipName, board) {
    const shipElement = document.querySelector(`[data-ship="${shipName}"]`);
    // Update only this element
}
```

## Issue #6: Missing Event Delegation Pattern (General) 🎪 **HIGH**

### Location
- **File:** battleship.html
- **Related to:** Issue #1
- **Lines:** Multiple locations throughout event handling code

### Problem Description
Beyond the `renderBoard()` function, the codebase follows an anti-pattern of attaching listeners to individual elements rather than using event delegation. This is a systemic architectural issue.

### Impact
- **Severity:** High (architectural)
- **Code Quality:** Violates modern JavaScript best practices
- **Scalability:** Makes the code harder to maintain and extend

### Examples
- Individual button listeners (lines 736-750)
- Cell-by-cell event attachment (lines 769-804)
- Lack of centralized event management

### Suggested Solution
Implement comprehensive event delegation strategy:
1. Use event delegation for all dynamic content
2. Create centralized event handler functions
3. Leverage event bubbling for cleaner code

**Note:** Issue #1 fix partially addresses this for board rendering.
